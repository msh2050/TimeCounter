#TimeCounter#

This is a light library, which will help you to convert seconds to time (HH:MM:SS)
If you need other format, you must use the extended functions and edit the library to give you the needed results
I add this library because it take less footprint and easy use in my example
Please not that you should make the counter yourself, for me... I use tasks to count seconds
